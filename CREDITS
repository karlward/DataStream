DataStream was inspired by Don Coleman's ByteStream library.  Unfortunately, 
ByteStream was not suitable for easy handling of types larger than 1 byte, 
which is why DataStream was created. 

Most of this work was done under the auspices of an NYU ITP in-house 
internship with Tom Igoe during Summer 2013.  

Tom Igoe and Surya Mattu contributed to the very early design phase, before 
any of us realized that DataStream might be necessary for some of the 
thornier problems lurking in the design of the Arduino Filter library.  

REFERENCES
Filter used scaffold code from: 
- http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial (public domain example)
- https://github.com/don/ArduinoByteStream (LGPL library)

The Arduino base libraries were also consulted for learning purposes, but no 
code was incorporated from those sources.

The Arduino Filter library was the original driver behind the DataStream 
project:

Matthew Murdoch's ArduinoUnit testing library is great.  And the ByteStream unit tests proved very helpful.
